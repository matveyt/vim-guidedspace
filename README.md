### Description

This plugin shows thin lines at indentation levels. Think it as a lightweight
re-implementation of "indentLine" or such.

#### Download and Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/matveyt/vim-guidedspace ~/.vim/pack/manual/start/vim-guidedspace
```

### Usage

```vimL

in your vimrc in this order. For Neovim it's a builtin default.
