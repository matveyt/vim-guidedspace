### Description

This plugin shows thin lines at indentation levels. Think it as a lightweight
re-implementation of "indentLine" or such.

### Download and Install

Use whatever plugin manager to pull the master branch.

### Usage

For Vim make sure you have usual

```vimL
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on
```

in your vimrc in this order. For Neovim it's a builtin default.
